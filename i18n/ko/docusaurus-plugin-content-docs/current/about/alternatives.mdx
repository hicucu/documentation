History of architecture approaches

## Big Ball of Mud

<WIP ticket="258" />

> What is it; Why is it so common; When it starts to bring problems; What to do and how does FSD help in this

- [(Article) Oleg Isonen - Last words on UI architecture before an AI takes over](https://oleg008.medium.com/last-words-on-ui-architecture-before-an-ai-takes-over-468c78f18f0d)
- [(Report) Julia Nikolaeva, iSpring - Big Ball of Mud and other problems of the monolith, we have handled](http://youtu.be/gna4Ynz1YNI)
- [(Article) DD - Big Ball of mud](https://thedomaindrivendesign.io/big-ball-of-mud/)


## Smart & Dumb components

<WIP ticket="214" />

> About the approach; About applicability in the frontend; Methodology position

About obsolescence, about a new view from the methodology

Why component-containers approach is evil?

- [(Article) Den Abramov-Presentation and Container Components (TLDR: deprecated)](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0)


## Design Principles

<WIP ticket="59" />

> What are we talking about; FSD position

SOLID, GRASP, KISS, YAGNI, ... - and why they don't work well together in practice

And how does it aggregate these practices

- [(Talk) Ilya Azin - Feature-Sliced Design (fragment about Design Principles)](https://youtu.be/SnzPAr_FJ7w?t=380)


## DDD

<WIP ticket="1" />

> About the approach; Why does it work poorly in practice

What is the difference, how does it improve applicability, where does it adopt practices

- [(Article) DDD, Hexagonal, Onion, Clean, CQRS, ... How I put it all together](https://herbertograca.com/2017/11/16/explicit-architecture-01-ddd-hexagonal-onion-clean-cqrs-how-i-put-it-all-together/)
- [(Talk) Ilya Azin - Feature-Sliced Design (fragment about Clean Architecture, DDD)](https://youtu.be/SnzPAr_FJ7w?t=528)


## Clean Architecture

<WIP ticket="165" />

> About the approach; About applicability in the frontend; FSD position

How are they similar (to many), how are they different

- [(Thread) About use-case/interactor in the methodology](https://t.me/feature_sliced/3897)
- [(Thread) About DI in the methodology](https://t.me/feature_sliced/4592)

- [(Article) Misconceptions of Clean Architecture](http://habr.com/ru/company/mobileup/blog/335382/)


## Frameworks

<WIP ticket="58" />

> About applicability in the frontend; Why frameworks do not solve problems; why there is no single approach; FSD position

Framework-agnostic, conventional-approach

- [(Article) About the reasons for creating the methodology (fragment about frameworks)](/docs/about/motivation)
- [(Thread) About the applicability of the methodology for different frameworks](https://t.me/feature_sliced/3867)


## Atomic Design

<WIP ticket="204" />

> About the approach; About applicability in the frontend; FSD position

About compatibility, applicability in methodology and scope of responsibility, mapping layers

- [Atomic Design Methodology](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/)
- [(Thread) About applicability in shared / ui](https://t.me/feature_sliced/1653)
- [(Video) Briefly about Atomic Design](https://youtu.be/Yi-A20x2dcA)
- [(Talk) Ilya Azin - Feature-Sliced Design (fragment about Atomic Design)](https://youtu.be/SnzPAr_FJ7w?t=587)


## Feature Driven

<WIP ticket="219" />

> About the approach; About applicability in the frontend; FSD position

About compatibility, historical development and comparison

- [(Talk) Oleg Isonen - Feature Driven Architecture](https://youtu.be/BWAeYuWFHhs)
- [Feature Driven-Short specification (from the point of view of FSD)](https://github.com/feature-sliced/documentation/tree/rc/feature-driven)
